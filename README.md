# Stats-ML
Gibbs Sampler and Monte Carlo Markov Chain  (MCMC) Metropolis Hastings ALgorithm  fot Bayesian Inference done from scratch. Just declare Y (vector) as dependend and X (Matrix) as independent Variable.
Returns trace plots, histograms and boostrap estimators. 
MCMC: Play around with tau to scale Fisher Information Matrix (deciding over step size of the algorithm)
Also, use standardized data to avoid "divide by zero".
